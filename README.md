# instacart_data_analysis
first repo analyzing instacart's data


Hello Friends!

This is an analysis of instacart's published data. I took a sample of 10k of the 3.2m records and clustered the data by creating dummy variables and performed further EDA to get a deeper understanding of the data.

Enjoy!
